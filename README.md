# Quantum-Attack-Simulator

This is a simple educational Python project created to demonstrate the concept of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) by simulating a basic cryptographic algorithm and showing how it could be broken by quantum computing techniques in the future.

## 🔐 Purpose

Quantum computing poses a threat to many classical cryptographic algorithms currently in use, especially those based on RSA and ECC. This repository is part of a research-driven initiative to:

- Demonstrate the vulnerability of common encryption methods to quantum attacks.
- Raise awareness about the urgency of adopting post-quantum cryptographic solutions.
- Serve as a stepping stone for further development in post-quantum cybersecurity and education.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The Python script performs:

- A basic encryption operation using a classical algorithm (e.g., RSA-like).
- A simulation of a quantum-based attack (e.g., using Shor's Algorithm principles).
- A brief explanation of why classical algorithms are at risk.

> **Note:** This is a conceptual simulation. It does not require an actual quantum computer.

## 🧠 Who Should Use This

- Students and professionals exploring quantum threats.
- Recruiters or employers interested in my background in cybersecurity and quantum computing.
Anyone interested in understanding PQC through code.

## 📚 Background

This project is part of a broader research proposal titled:

> *"Post-Quantum Cybersecurity Threats in Local Governments: An Interdisciplinary Approach from a Criminological and Technological Perspective."*

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [x] Quantum attack simulation prototype
